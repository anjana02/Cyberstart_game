Spam For Dinner

Agent, we're trying to distract the gang whilst we try and gain access to their primary server and we think we've found a target for you.

We want to spam the booking form for their restaurants, if we can create enough incorrect bookings that'll make a real mess to keep them distracted. The problem is the form is protected by a captcha.

Tip: Find a way to bypass the captcha

Tip: Prove you can bypass it by tricking the form into using the same captcha every time you submit the form.

Tip: After submitting the form with the same captcha several times in a row, you will be given the flag.

Finally my web skills coming in useful. After we inspect in requests, we can see it sends the seedID along with the captcha in order to validate it.

Additionally, if we peek at the source we can see that:

<a href="#" onclick="var t=document.getElementById(&quot;captcha&quot;); t.src=t.src+&quot;&amp;&quot;+Math.random();">
        <img id="captcha" src="/challenge-files/hq/1311/PureCaptcha/purecaptcha_img.php?t=login_form&amp;seedID=12:15:14:4" height="22">
      </a>

The captcha image is pulled from their server using the seedID. Therefore, the seedID and captcha match up.

So all we have to do it supply the exact same seedID and captcha each time we submit the form.

A simple curl and changing the submitted name works great.
