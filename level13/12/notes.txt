Agent, we've managed to get physical access to a router the gang are using on their ship. We want you to use that access to get the username and password for SSH.

Tip: Send the username and password to our undercover by text to get the flag. The message should be in the format: username / password.


This leads me to believe we are supposed to brute force the SSH login.
