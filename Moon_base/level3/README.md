Programming
============

3.1 Introduction
---------------

Learning to program is a key step in understanding how computers work. More than that, it's incredibly useful to be able to put together a quick program which will do something automatically that would otherwise take a long time to do. Don't be intimidated by the word 'programming', once you break it down it's really very simple.

In this manual, we'll touch on a few different programming languages but our main focus will be Python. Python is simple and easy to learn. That's the reason it's used by a lot of people who work in information security.

There's one important rule you should know about programming: If your program doesn't work the first time, Google is your friend. If you've run into a problem, chances are it's a pretty common error. You will usually find the answer with a quick Google search - programmers help each other out all the time online.

3.2 High Level vs Low Level Programming Languages
------------------------------------------------

Before we start actually learning how to program, it's important to understand the differences between types of languages. A computer does not understand programming languages. There is only one thing that a computer can understand: binary. Programming languages exist to make our lives easier; no one wants to write a program in meaningless 1s and 0s. Instead, we use a programming language and, once the program is written, it gets converted automatically into something that the computer understands.

Programming languages that are the closest to binary are called low level programming languages, for example 'assembly'. Low level languages are often hard to learn and harder to write programs in.

High level languages are furthest away from binary. They hide most of the complexity and do a lot of things for the programmer. An example of a high level programming language would be Python.

To illustrate the differences, I'm going to produce a small program that, when run, will output some text to the screen in three different programming languages: assembly, C and Python. Don't panic! You don't need to know how to program in assembly or C.

Python (helloworld.py):

                 `print("Hello, World!")`
